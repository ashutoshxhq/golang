# Variables
In this section we are going to discuss about variables in golang.

## Data Types

1. **Numbers**

| Data Type         | Description                |
| ------------------|:---------------------------------------:|
| int8              | 8 bit signed integer       |
| int16             | 16 bit signed integer      |
| int32             | 32 bit signed integer      |
| int64             | 64 bit signed integer      |
| uint8             | 8 bit unsigned integer     |
| uint16            | 16 bit unsigned integer    |
| uint32            | 32 bit unsigned integer    |
| uint64            | 64 bit unsigned integer    |
| int               | either 32 or 64 bit        |
| uint              | either 32 or 64 bit        |
| rune              | synonym of int32           |
| byte              | synonym of int8            |
| uintptr           | all the bits of pointer value  |

2. **Floating-Point Numbers**

| Data Type         | Description                |
| ------------------|:---------------------------------------:|
| float32              | 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number     |
| float64             | 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number   |


3. **Complex Numbers**

| Data Type         | Description                |
| ------------------|:---------------------------------------:|
| complex64              | Complex numbers which contain float32 as a real and imaginary component.     |
| complex128             | Complex numbers which contain float64 as a real and imaginary component.   |
